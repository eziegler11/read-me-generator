# Professional ReadMe Generator

## Description

I was motivated to create this project as an easier way to generate a ReadMe without leaving your coding platform. I built this because I wanted an integrated and interactive way to generate a ReadMe by using prompts. It solves the problem of not having to remember the required headings in a ReadMe and instead populates that information for you based on your answers. I learned more about Node JS and how to write a file to my local machine. But even more so, how to create multiple prompts and use the answers from those prompts to populate information within a file.

## Installation

The steps to install my project are as follows:
- Clone or fork my code from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies (Inquirer)
- Run the file from the command line using "node index.js"

## Usage

Here is a link to a video of the file running.

Here is an example of the file running within the terminal to generate the ReadMe.
